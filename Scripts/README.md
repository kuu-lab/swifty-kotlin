# Scripts workflow

## Inventory

| Script | CI | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `swift_test.sh` | ✓ | `swift test` wrapper: parallel defaults, grouped failure summary, golden-update hint, GitHub annotations |
| `shard_swift_tests.sh` | ✓ | Split one slow test target across CI jobs (`--mode dynamic` per-test / `--mode static` per-suite) |
| `diff_kotlinc.sh` | ✓ | Behavioral diff of `kswiftc` vs `kotlinc` over `diff_cases/`; persists failure artifacts |
| `diff_kotlinc_ci_summary.sh` | ✓ | Render the diff TSV report as a markdown step summary with embedded diffs |
| `loc_report.sh` | – | Refactoring guard metrics as TSV (LoC by directory, `kk_` literals, TODO/FIXME counts) |
| `dead_code_audit.sh` | – | Audit `@_cdecl kk_*` runtime symbols unreachable from the compiler |
| `check_todo_ids.sh` | – | Detect duplicate task IDs in `TODO.md` |
| `validate_runtime_abi_links.sh` | – | Shorthand for the `RuntimeABIExternalLinkValidationTests` filter |
| `lib/common.sh` | (sourced) | Shared helpers: worker detection, interleaved sharding, filter chunking, case-name sanitizing |

## swift_test.sh

`Scripts/swift_test.sh` wraps `swift test` with parallel execution enabled by default.

- Tune XCTest workers: `SWIFT_TEST_WORKERS=4 bash Scripts/swift_test.sh`. When
  the test bundle contains Swift Testing sources, the wrapper omits
  `--num-workers` because SwiftPM supports that option only for XCTest.
- Tune build jobs: `SWIFT_TEST_BUILD_JOBS=4 bash Scripts/swift_test.sh`
- Disable parallel mode: `SWIFT_TEST_PARALLEL=0 bash Scripts/swift_test.sh`

When you are iterating on test failures after a successful build, you can also
reuse the existing build products:

```bash
bash Scripts/swift_test.sh --skip-build
```

## Runtime ABI link validation

Validate compiler runtime link names against `RuntimeABISpec`:

```bash
bash Scripts/validate_runtime_abi_links.sh
```

## TODO hygiene

Detect duplicate task IDs in `TODO.md`:

```bash
bash Scripts/check_todo_ids.sh
```

## Golden update workflow

1. Run golden tests without updating fixtures:

```bash
bash Scripts/swift_test.sh --filter Golden
```

2. Review differences:

```bash
git diff -- Tests/CompilerCoreTests/GoldenCases
```

3. If the parser/sema/lowering change is intentional, update fixtures
   (the `-swift-version` flags match the CI language mode):

```bash
UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 bash Scripts/swift_test.sh --filter matchesGolden -Xswiftc -swift-version -Xswiftc 6
```

4. Re-review fixture changes and ensure only intended files changed:

```bash
git status --short
git diff -- Tests/CompilerCoreTests/GoldenCases
```

5. Validate before commit:

```bash
bash Scripts/swift_test.sh
bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh Scripts/diff_cases
```

### Golden stability (after harness / concurrency changes)

Golden tests run each case in a dedicated worker process so `swift test --parallel` can fan them out safely. To sanity-check flakiness after harness changes, run the filter twice (or more):

```bash
bash Scripts/swift_test.sh --filter Golden
bash Scripts/swift_test.sh --filter Golden
```

## kotlinc diff workflow

Run one case:

```bash
bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh Scripts/diff_cases/hello.kt
```

Run all tracked regression cases:

```bash
bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh Scripts/diff_cases
```

For coroutine/Flow cases, `diff_kotlinc.sh` can automatically download
`kotlinx-coroutines-core-jvm` when needed (if no `--kotlinc-classpath` is
set).  
You can control the cached path and version with:

```bash
export KOTLINC_COROUTINES_VERSION=1.10.2
export KOTLINC_DEP_DIR=/path/to/.runtime-build/deps
```

Downloads are checksum-verified. For versions without a checksum baked into
the script, also set:

```bash
export KOTLINC_COROUTINES_SHA256=<expected sha256 of the jar>
```

Emit a machine-readable report (TSV) for CI tooling:

```bash
bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh --report /tmp/diff_report.tsv Scripts/diff_cases
```

Omit `PASS` lines in logs (CI uses `DIFF_LOG_PASS=0`):

```bash
DIFF_LOG_PASS=0 bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh Scripts/diff_cases
```

You can control parallel execution. The worker count is set by `--jobs <n>`
(or the equivalent `DIFF_WORKERS` env var); `0` means serial. By default the
script runs in parallel with one worker per CPU:

```bash
# Set the worker count explicitly (0 = serial)
bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh --jobs 4 Scripts/diff_cases
DIFF_WORKERS=4 bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh Scripts/diff_cases

# Disable parallel execution
bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh --no-parallel Scripts/diff_cases
DIFF_PARALLEL=0 bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh Scripts/diff_cases
```

`DIFF_PARALLEL` is a boolean toggle (`0` = serial, `1` = parallel, the
default). Setting it to a number greater than 1 is deprecated — it prints a
warning and is treated as `DIFF_WORKERS`.

`DIFF_WORKERS` parallelizes within one machine. To split the case
set across several machines (CI shards the regression this way; the current
shard count is the diff-regression matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`),
use interleaved sharding — case `i` runs only when `i % count == index`:

```bash
# 4 shards; each prints/reports only its ~1/4 of the cases.
DIFF_SHARD_INDEX=0 DIFF_SHARD_COUNT=4 bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh Scripts/diff_cases
DIFF_SHARD_INDEX=1 DIFF_SHARD_COUNT=4 bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh Scripts/diff_cases
# ...and shards 2, 3 on other machines. Combine with --jobs for per-machine parallelism.

# Equivalent flags
bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc.sh --shard-index 0 --shard-count 4 Scripts/diff_cases
```

Sharding and `DIFF_WORKERS` compose: a shard still runs its slice across the
configured workers. `DIFF_SHARD_COUNT=1` (the default) disables sharding.

Render a markdown summary from that report:

```bash
bash Scripts/diff_kotlinc_ci_summary.sh --report /tmp/diff_report.tsv --summary /tmp/step_summary.md
```

## CI test sharding

`shard_swift_tests.sh` splits one test target across several CI jobs using the
same interleaved rule as `diff_kotlinc.sh` sharding. Pure XCTest targets can
shard per-test (`--mode dynamic`, backed by `swift test list`); targets that
mix Swift Testing shard per-suite (`--mode static`, backed by source scanning):

```bash
bash Scripts/shard_swift_tests.sh --mode dynamic --list-filter '^CompilerBackendTests\.' \
  --shard-index 0 --shard-count 6
bash Scripts/shard_swift_tests.sh --mode static --tests-dir Tests/CompilerCoreTests \
  --target-prefix CompilerCoreTests --shard-index 0 --shard-count 4
```

## Refactoring guard metrics

`loc_report.sh` emits the metrics used as the RF-series refactor gate,
including phase-target path counts for Sema/DataFlow, TypeCheck, and legacy
CallLowerer files (see `docs/refactoring-metrics.md` for the tracked baseline
and CI artifact name):

```bash
bash Scripts/loc_report.sh > after.tsv
```

## Dead-code audit

`dead_code_audit.sh` lists `@_cdecl kk_*` runtime symbols that no compiler
path can emit (see `docs/dead-code-audit.md` for the exclusion pipeline):

```bash
bash Scripts/dead_code_audit.sh --verbose
```

The `Quarterly Audits` workflow runs this audit with the fiction audit on the
first day of January, April, July, and October. Its summary and the intermediate
audit files are retained as a 90-day GitHub Actions artifact.
