/// pipeline.  This context currently provides:
///
/// 1. **Scope lookup cache** – avoids repeated walks up the scope chain for the
///    same name in the same scope object.  All results of ``Scope.lookup(_:)``
///    are cached until the enclosing scope is invalidated.
/// 2. **Symbol lookup cache** – avoids repeated bounds-checked array accesses
///    for ``SymbolTable.symbol(_:)`` with the same ``SymbolID``.  Both successful
///    lookups and known misses (invalid / out-of-bounds IDs) are cached.
/// 3. **Overload-resolution cache** – memoizes successful overload-resolution
///    results so that identical resolution requests do not need to be recomputed.
///    Only successful resolutions are cached; failing calls are never recorded.
///
/// When caching is disabled (the default), all call-sites receive `nil` and fall
/// back to the original uncached paths.
